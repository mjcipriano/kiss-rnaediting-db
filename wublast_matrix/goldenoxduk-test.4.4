# NOTE: a score of -10000 (or less) is interpreted by WU-BLAST 2.0
# to mean that the substitution is absolutely disallowed.
# Other versions of BLAST may, however, treat low scores of -10000 or less
# differently (e.g., as literal substitution score values).
#
# Only ACGT are specified below for Subject COLUMN headings and Query ROW
# labels, because omitted letters have implicit (default) substitution scores
# of -10000 against all letters in the alphabet and are not allowed to appear
# in reported alignments (see above for the treatment of scores <= -10000).  It
#is also relevant to the statistics that the assumed background frequencies
#P(A), P(C), P(G), and P(T) all sum to 1.  In other words, letters other than A,
#C, G and T are assumed to have background frequencies of 0, even though they
#may appear at some frequency in the actual query and database sequences.
#
# Due to the specific definition of identity scoring and the background
# frequencies presented here, the same file can serve both as the .4.4 file
# and the .4.2 file.  For more complicated scoring situations, the .4.2 file
# may have 15 rows and 4 columns; and the .4.4 file may have 15 rows
# and 15 columns.
#
# The 2-bit .2 alphabet is simply ACGT
#
# The complete 4-bit .4 alphabet is
# ACGT RYMKWSBDHVN -
