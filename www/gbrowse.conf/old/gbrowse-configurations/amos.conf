citation     = Assembly of whole genome shotgun sequences Scaffolds consists of an ordered list of contigs, all forward-oriented, and estimates for the gaps between them within the scaffold.  A contig is defined as a contiguous region of DNA consensus sequence constructed by aligning many sequence "reads" (one "read" is the data generated from one sequencing reaction).

key          = Read, Partner within Same Contig
citation     = Reads whose partners have been placed in the same contig, implying that the clone has been placed uniquely within the assembly.  Based upon the estimated insert size ranges for the shotgun libraries, the colors of the reads will show red if the insert size was larger then expected and pink if the insert size is smaller then expected.
