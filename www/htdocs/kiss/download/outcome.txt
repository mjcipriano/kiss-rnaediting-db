Database Construction

-In silico identification of gRNA genes

All minicircle sequences were aligned to EST sequences using the WuBlast program. A modified similarity matrix was created 












---------------------------------------------
Overview of data the Database Contains

The database contains Transcripts, Minicircles, pre-edited and completely edited maxicircle genes, sequenced gRNAs, predicted gRNAs.

Description of how prediction of gRNA is made.
-The algorithm:
  Minicircle sequences are aligned to transcript sequences while scoring G-U base pairings as an identity.  Areas of identity larger then 22bp's are annotated as possible gRNA sequences.

Description different views:
*Viewing a Minicircle
-Matches to transcripts and maxicircle genes
-Matches to sequenced gRNA's (gcDNA)
-Matches to Kinetoplsatid gRNA's (published)
-Inverted Repeats
-Matches to Conserved Regions

*Viewing a Transcript
-Matches to the edited and pre-edited portions of the transcript
-Matches to sequenced minicircles
-Matches to sequenced gRNA's (gcDNA)

*Viewing a Maxicircle Gene (pre-edited and fully edited versions)
-Matches to Transcipts
  -Specific Amplified, Bloodstream
  -Specific Amplified, Bloodstream Fractions
  -Specific Amplified, Procyclic
  -Specific Amplified, Procyclic Fractions
  -Poly-dt primed, Procyclic
-Matches to Minicircles (predicted gRNAs)
-Matches to sequenced gRNAs (gcDNA)
-PCR Primers
